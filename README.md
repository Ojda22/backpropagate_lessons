# Content of the repository 👨🏻‍💻✅

2. [evoluationary_algorithms](./evolutionary_algorithms) - Contains the implementation of various evolutionary algorithms.

# How to get started 🛠️

First and only requirement is to have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your machine.

To run and setup the repo locally, you can use the following commands:

```commandline
poetry update && source .venv/bin/activate
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies and activate the virtual environment.

To install poetry, you can follow the instructions from the [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).



To run any of the scripts it will often be enough to run:
```commandline
python <path_to_the_script> / <script_name>.py
```
