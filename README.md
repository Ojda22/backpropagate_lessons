# Content of the repository 👨🏻‍💻✅

1. [README.md](./README.md) - This file, which provides an overview of the project and how to get started.
2. [evoluationary_algorithms](./evolutionary_algorithms) - Contains the implementation of various evolutionary algorithms.

# How to get started 🛠️

First and only requirement is to have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your machine.

To run and setup the repo locally, you need to install poetry for dependency management:
To install poetry, you can follow the instructions from the [official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

And then you can use the following commands:

```commandline
poetry update && source .venv/bin/activate
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies and activate the virtual environment such as that you don't contaminate your global Python environment with the dependencies of this project.

To run any of the scripts it will often be enough to run (unless otherwise specified in the script directory README):
```commandline
python <path_to_the_script> / <script_name>.py
```

Happy learning and experimenting!
